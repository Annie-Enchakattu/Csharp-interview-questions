implicitly typed 
variables var - was not designed 
to replace normal variable 
declaration but for 
special case situations such as LINQ

var variables are automatically 
deduced at compile time

dynamic type - compiler 
does not check type of 
variable at compile type - type of variable determined at runtime

implicitly typed variables 
are declared using the var keyword

dynamic variables are 
declared with the keyword dynamic

implicitly typed variables (var) 
type is determined at compile type

dynamic variables type are 
determined at runtime
