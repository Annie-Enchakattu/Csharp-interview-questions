implicitly typed 
variables var - was not designed 
to replace normal variable 
declaration but for 
special case situations such as LINQ

var variables are automatically 
deduced at compile time

dynamic type - compiler 
does not check type of 
variable at compile type - type of variable determined at runtime

implicitly typed variables 
are declared using the var keyword

dynamic variables are 
declared with the keyword dynamic

implicitly typed variables (var) 
type is determined at compile type

dynamic variables type are 
determined at runtime

implicitly typed 
variables var should be declared
so compiler can determine time at
compile time

dynamic variable need not be initialized as compiler does not need to know type at 
compile time

var a = 10;
a = "a" //will throw an error

dynamic a = 10; 
a = "a"; // does not cause error

implicitly typed 
variables var cannot be used for properties
and returning values from functions

dynamic variables can be used as properties and used a return values for functions
